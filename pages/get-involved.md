It's easy to get involved with our lab! We are always looking for bright, 
motivated, and enthusiastic students who are interested in our lab. The 
following are the steps to follow to get involved:
<ol>
    <li><b>Look at our website for open positions.</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The positions on our website will give you a better idea of the type
of work we do and what you would be doing if you joined our lab. Various skills 
are listed under each position. The listed skills are not necessarily required 
for you to have experience in prior to working in our lab. You can think of 
these as skills you will have acquired after working in our lab. Look through 
our <a href="/open-positions/">open positions</a> and choose a couple you would be interested in.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Contact us.</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>After you have found a couple positions you are interested in, 
email us! It would be best to <a href="/contact/">contact the project manager</a> by email, and include 
the following information:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your class standing</li>
            <li>Major and track (if you know)</li>
            <li>Positions you are interested in</li>
            <li>Why you would like to join our lab</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Meet with us.</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>We will respond within a week to your email, and set up a time to 
meet with you.</li>
        <li>The purpose of this meeting is to get to know more about you and 
your interests. We also want to learn more about your experience with EE-related
projects and classes you have taken.</li>

        <li>Please bring the following with you to the meeting:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A resume that includes your project experience and classes you
