<h2>Weatherbox</h2>

Currently, this is the largest and most active project under our lab.

The objective of this project is to design and develop low-cost, accurate, and 
reliable environmental sensor modules that can easily be reproduced for mass 
deployment on rooftops across the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus. The 
meteorological data collected from these modules will assist in planning future 
renewable energy installations as well as providing risk mitigation for 
electricity generation through the development of renewable resource prediction 
and forecasting algorithms.

<h2>Forecasting</h2>

Forecasting is predicting the future based on previous and present data and 
trends in data. Using machine learning techniques such as linearization and 
classification, we analysis data from the weatherbox to make algorithms to help 
optimize the weatherbox.

<h2>Wind Sensor</h2>

The objective of the wind sensor project is to build a wind sensor that is low 
cost, small, reliable, durable, and has no moving parts. The current model is 
the Kiwi Passive Acoustic Anemometer, which is built using microphones. We want 
our sensor to detect wind speed and direction in 2D. Once a complete, working 
model is built, it will be integrated to the weatherbox. The data from the wind 
sensor can be used for predicting where buildings can be built with natural 
ventilation.
