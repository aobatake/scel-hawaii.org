The Smart Campus Energy Lab (SCEL) was created in 2010 with the intent of 
tackling the task of creating a low-cost, self sustaining meteorological sensor 
platform. Initially a project of Justin Carland, that particular project has 
become one of the largest projects that SCEL has.

SCEL joined the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program in Fall 2015.
