  <h1> Smart Campus Energy Lab </h1>

  <p>The Smart Campus Energy Lab (SCEL) was created in 2010 with the intent of 
  tackling the task of creating a low-cost, self sustaining meteorological sensor 
  platform. Initially a project of Justin Carland, that particular project has 
  become one of the largest projects that SCEL has.</p>

  <p>SCEL joined the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program in Fall 2015.</p>
